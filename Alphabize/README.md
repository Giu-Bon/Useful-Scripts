# 📖 Alphabize - Your noobly Programmed Phonetic Alphabet Translator  

## Why does it exsist?
I created this script because I have a long name, and spelling it out over the phone is frustrating. To make life easier, I wrote this program to instantly translate words into both the **NATO** and **German** phonetic alphabets. Now, instead of struggling to spell my name or Email over the Phone, I can just let my code do the work! 🚀
> Funfact:  
> This was originally written when GPT2 released and it was a pain in the but to bugfix its code so i learned python... please don't criticize this code it works and was written (as the title suggests) by a newby.

## 🎯 Features  
- Translates any word into both **NATO (English)** and **German** phonetic alphabets.  
- Displays the output in a clean, easy-to-read table.  
- Simple ~~and lightweight~~ — you wish. Simple yes... Lightweight no.  
- Helps me not stuttering random picked words over the phone.

## 📥 Installation & Usage  
### 🔧 Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  

### ⬇️ Setup  
1. Clone the **Useful-Scripts** repository and navigate to the folder:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giu-Bon/Useful-Scripts.git
   cd Useful-Scripts/Alphabize
   ```
2. Ensure you have the required `.txt` files:  
   - `nato_alphabet.txt`  
   - `german_alphabet.txt`  

3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python translator.py
   ```
4. Enter a word when prompted, and the script will generate the phonetic spelling.  

## 📌 Example Output  
```
   |------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |   Letter  |-|       German      |-|       English     |-|        |
   |------------------------------------------------------------------|

   |------------------------------------------------------------------|
```

## 😤 I hate that it uses "A-Word" for the Letter "*" 
Just change the .txt 
### I hate that you used not the official word for the Letter "*"
I didnt wanna look up the alphabets again and had more success with those words.

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
- Change .txt to .md cause Obsidian... and it looks prettier.
- rewrite the code. it sucks
