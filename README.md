## What is this?

Welcome to my script repository! Here you'll find a variety of useful scripts I've created.  
Please note that those Scripts are super simple and the `README.md` are overly written to train myself for later actual big Projects. Like my future Blog

Feel free to browse, use, and adapt the scripts to your needs! If you come up with improvements or new features, Iâ€™d love for you to submit a commit request.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

Hereâ€™s an overview of what you can expect to find in this repository:  

- **Installation Scripts:** Easy autoinstall after a fresh Fedora install.
- **Tmux Session Loader:** Quickly create and load Tmux sessions. Great for a logon Script.  
- **A lot more:** I can see myself not adding it in this list if i created something... so best bet to just browse through it.

## Languages

Most scripts in this repository are written in either:  
- **Bash**
- **Python**
- **Fish**
- **Markdown** (_Well kinda... they are being used for a script ever once in a while_)

> **Why would anyone use Markdown instead of a txt**  
> Easy: *I want to Edit it in Obsidian...*
